I don’t wanna work. I want to play until it is dark out and then die peacefully. I want to spend my time interacting with people, objects, relationships and culture. Each a fresh box of play-doh. All play and no work makes Jack a self-actualized boy. 

Hot off the press: The future of work is remote. Now you can click buttons all day in the comfort of a La-Z-boy and silk pajamas. No more commutes and a virtual community! More immunity against the virus! Mute yourself, fart and unmute without anyone knowing! We’ll give you a desk stipend! Let’s work asynchronously around the clock. I’m not a fan….except the free farting. 

Knock brushes mask the birds chirping outside. Every Interaction preceded by “are you free for a call?”. The new world order of productivity tools dictate my every move. Sigh. I wish Adam Sandler from Click could give a keynote speech to all knowledge workers. 

I join a sea of 120 x 120 pixel boxes. Sunken faces in front of beach backgrounds. Your microphone is not working for you. Conversating endlessly with my screen is not working for me. You went on a beach vacation last month. According to the algorithm, your expected output post-vacation is +13%. A calculated move to avoid burnout and optimize churning. Gotta love a true mission-driven company. 

I used to love it. It being the medium for relationships. A tap on the shoulder, team dinners, white boarding sessions, insides jokes preserved by a distinct few. A common thread to share hardships and celebrate triumphs. The antithesis of long lost friends grasping to find bridges at a reunion. 

I am scared to retire indefinitely. I am scared because it is the path less travelled. If I lose my way, nobody is around to save me. They are itching to tell you ‘I told you so’. A sense of shared misery is sweeter than isolation.

The road I am on is well paved. Or so I’m told. It would be foolish to leave. The road merges into the career highway. Once I am there, it is just smooth sailing. Or so I am told. I stare at the abyss on both sides. The car is cool and comfortable with heated leather seats and a sunroof. The ultimate destination is only a couple days away. But it’s groundhog’s day and I’m Bill Murray.

I am allowed to leave the road when I am old. Old is an age when I don’t have responsibilities and it’s acceptable to just be. Ask the elderly what they regret most. They unanimously regret working too much. They wish they had spent more time on family, hobbies and life experiences. But they are probably wrong. The future is now old man. I’ll get that promotion and everything will be swell. Or so I’m told. 

I want to die rich in experiences. The last drops of my bank account squeezed into a bucket list. The bucket isn’t predetermined. The story unfolds as each chapter is written. It’s never too early to start filling the bucket. The best time to start was 10 years ago and the second best time is now. 

My ego wants to establish a legacy. A career is a staple ingredient in a well rounded legacy. He who amassed the most wealth. Moved the biggest boulders. Influenced the largest currents. The ego wants to be remembered for something. Fight the currents of time to permanently etch its name in the sands. I am special and the world will know it, says the ego. Who is this “world” and why is their opinion so important? 

Soon the moon rises and the tides grow stronger. The names etched in history disappear into the ether. The sands are not lost as matter is neither created nor destroyed. It simply returns to the whole.
