Easy friends

Of of my favorite lounge wear is easy shorts by Uniqlo. They are stylish, easy to wear with stretchy fabric. The quintessential athleisure. But what makes it easy? The premise is that comfortable clothing can be stylish. I don’t need a belt. Easy. I can get it dirty and stains wash right out. Easy. I can fart unceremoniously and have the gas easily escape. Easy?

Hanging out with easy friends never feels like a chore

Those pants are the premise. I want to live an easy life. And that starts with easy relationships. 

I only want easy friends in my life. 


Easy friends validate themselves. It is not your responsibility to make them feel good about themselves. Easy friends invest in you as much as you invest in them.

Easy friends are not needy. They have needs and learn to manage them

Easy friends are curious. I like people who have a sense of wonder in the world. 

Friends are those who inspire you. You choose your friends. As you grow older, it is important that you curate your time to spend with those who mean the most to you. If you sigh at the thought of spending time with someone, that’s a burden. Maybe you dont want to hurt their feelings or maybe you find them useful in some situations. There are empathetic ways to break up with friends who are not easy. 



Easy friends are mutualism at it’s core. They give and receive. They speak and listen. They are interesting and are interested. Easy friendships are not transactional. Easyfriends ask for advice but they know they alone are responsible for solving the problem.



We live in a society that places a large emphasis on 1 person fixing it all. 

Your “life” partner will be by your side, fuck you everyday, raise your children and retire peacefully with you. Your best friend will always be your best friend no matter how you change. Who is your best friend? Pick one! Your blood family is everything. You HAVE to maintain strong ties with your parents and siblings. 

Easy friends are easy because

Nobody is fully secure in every aspect of themselves. Relationships offer a beautiful support structure when things fail, you feel down about yourself. However, when you burden others with your problems, 


You and your easy friends are a venn diagram. You each bring something beautiful into the relationship when you are together but have personalities

Easy friends dont treat you as a means to an end. Your relationship with them is more important than the image you present. You are not a networking opportunity. You are not a puzzle to complete their life. You are not a beautiful face to make your instagram followers jealous.

Easy friends allow you to be who you are without a filter. They enjoy your presence. Your default state.

“Be the change you wish to see in this world” is a trite quote that I definitely wont be quoting in this article. LOL

Easy friends are also working on themselves. We help each other therapize. Easy friends dont expect therapists to just fix their problems. Like codeine to simply solve theor angst.

Easy friends. Just be an easy friend and you will get one in the mail. 

EasyFriends are the friendships you had before middle school. The ones that had nothing to do with startus, identity, complexion. The playful exploration of the world together. 

Easy friends are into metal and have goat tattoos. They simply own who they are and dont feel the need to impress. They

Easy friends enjoy each others company without having to do something. Time spent with easyfriends is leisure not work. 

Easy friends are fun. They make sure your cookie jar is full before they take cookies. They dont demand cookies when you yourself are starving. They accept cookies when you are ready to give.

EasyFriends are individuals with different group identities. They are not a husband within a couple, they are not the token brown kid, they are not another couple to go on a double date

Easy friends isnt about how much time you spend together but rather the quality of that time. 

EasyFriends inspire you. To think, to feel, to change, to accept. 

Easy friends are. They dont simply seem. 

This article isnt to call out uneasy friends. Share this article with them and appreciate the easy friends in your life. 

EasyFriends bring their complete self. 

Easyfriends can be contextual friends but contextual friends cant be easy friends


Nothing can be defined easily. I am gautam. All i can define is my characteristics. I am human, adult, male, height, weight etc. these are the characteristics of EasyFriends in my life. Define
