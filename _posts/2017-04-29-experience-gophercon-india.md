Read this article if you want to view your misery in a different light

### The why

Yes, there are plenty of folks who are miserable not being able to go to school or a bar or argue about the NFL draft at the work break room. Then there are those for whom “stir crazy” is only a bad Richard Pryor/Gene Wilder movie. 

They don’t know what “climbing the walls” is unless it’s at a gym, with rock climbing equipment, and not a lot of folks hanging around. (Introverts loath small talk.) Isolation isn’t dreaded but preferred. It is a time for internal reflection, a hallmark of introversion. It is time to read. Daydream.
