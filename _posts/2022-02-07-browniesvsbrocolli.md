Every product is either a brownie or a brocolli. The brownie caters to immediate gratification (feel good now, cure boredom, distract from pain). The brocolli is about the long term value (sacrifice now for compounded gains). The best way to sell brocolli is to pan fry it with salt and oil to make it more palateable. Salt and oil happen to be 2 key ingredients in brownies.
