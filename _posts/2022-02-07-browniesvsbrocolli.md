Every product is either a brownie or a brocolli. The product can be anything a consumer interacts with; the physical product, a website, marketing content etc.

Every manufacturer is in the feel-good game. The brownie caters to immediate gratification (feel good now, cure boredom, distract from pain). The brocolli focuses on long term value (sacrifice now for compounded gains). 

There is a little of each in the other; each the yin to the other's yang. The brownie contains eggs with protein to help build muscle and recover. The brocolli can be a refreshing palette cleanser after salty bites of orange chicken. 

Bake healthier brownies. Make them double protein or gluten free to give the long term brain something to feel good about. There is war in your consumer's minds. Equip them with a good counter argument for the inevitable self-hatred and criticism for eating an entire box of brownies. 

Make your brocolli more palettable. Make working out fun (Peloton). Make building a meditation habit easy (Headspace). Make ads for your productivity software ads more entertaining (ClickUp). The best way to sell brocolli is to pan fry it with salt and oil to make it more palateable. Salt and oil happen to be 2 key ingredients in brownies. 

Zucchini bread is the perfect product.
