If you ask most people what they want in life, you might get myriad of responses. The drunk will want nothing more than a crunchwrap supreme. The naiive will want to win the powerball. The Lonely will want a family and will settle for a dog. Prisoners will want freedom. So on and so forth. 

What all these answers have in common is an appeasement of the negative emotions. We are constantly fighting the feeling of not being ok. I'd rather be ok with not being ok because it's a lot simpler.  

This is what I want:

I want the sense of stillness inside when everything outside is on fire. It is the realistic, more graphic version of this meme.

The difference being that the dog is outwardly portraying a sense of stillness while panicking on the inside. The keeping up with the Jones' of personal well being. 

On the other hand, the monk is simply present in the sensation of his burning flesh. He truly believes "this is fine".
