If you ask most people what they want in life, you might get myriad of responses. The drunk will want nothing more than a crunchwrap supreme. The naiive will want to win the powerball. The Lonely will want a family and will settle for a dog. Prisoners will want freedom. The Rich will want a sense of family. 





We all create stories in our head and float away from the objective reality.
