I am a Gautam Ajay representing one Gautam Ajay.

Does a site have its own identity? It does because I believe in site rights. As a site, it has been difficult voicing my opinions but I am going to pass the mike

I am a Marketer currently working at Qualtrics. In my spare time, I like to cook, read, practice yoga, play guitar, meditate and spend time with friends. Just classic human stuff... not breaking the mold here.

I built this site as a vehicle to articulate my brain farts into a robust brain shit. It also allows me to create and own a brand from start to finish. My ideas will . I am not married to any of my ideas. I constantly change my mind so shoot me a note if you want to deliberate on any topic.
