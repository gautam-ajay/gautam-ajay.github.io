Hey there! I am a Gautam Ajay representing one Gautam Ajay.

Does a site have its own identity? It is if its owner believes in site rights. Quirky sells on the internet.

Gautam Ajay is an <strike>accommplished</strike> marketer with <strike>many</strike> 

In his spare time, he likes to [activity 1], [activity2] and occasionally [activity3]

I'd like to think that I have something interesting to add to the world but it is far more likely that I simply need a hobby during quarantine to keep me occupied.
