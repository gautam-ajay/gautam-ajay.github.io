I am a Gautam Ajay representing one Gautam Ajay.

Does a site have its own identity? It does when the owner believes in site rights.

I built this site to better articulate my brain farts into a robust brain shits. I am a jack of all trades and wanted a single platform to express the long list of my interests such as marketing, cooking, music theory, UX design, consumer psychology, mental wellness and  

I am not married to any of my ideas and I constantly change my mind. Shoot me a note if you want to deliberate on any topic or if you simply want to say hi ðŸ‘‹
